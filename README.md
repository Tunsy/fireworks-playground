# Fireworks Model Playground

A simple Next.js + React + Tailwind interface for experimenting with Fireworks AI models in a chat-style playground. Users can pick from a list of serverless models, send prompts, and see streaming responses in real time.

See the project live at https://fireworks-playground.vercel.app/

## Notes on design decisions
Next.js App Router with use client for interactive components.

Tailwind CSS (with the Typography plugin) for utility-first styling and automatic prose formatting.

Shadcn/UI components (Card, Button, Select) for a consistent look without heavy dependencies.

@ai-sdk/reactâ€™s useChat hook under the hood, proxying through our own /api/chat route which uses the OpenAI SDK pointed at Fireworks.

## Potential improvements
Model info panel: show model metadata (token limits, cost per token, etc.).

History & persistence: save chat history to local storage or a backend for reopening past sessions.

Reasoning: properly implement rendering of reasoning and chain of thought process for certain models.
